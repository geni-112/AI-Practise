# Huawei Cloud SEC EDGAR Big Data POC

## Core Rule

Never embed Huawei Cloud AK/SK, account passwords, DWS/MRS passwords, Superset passwords, SSH private keys, or Terraform state secrets in this skill, code, docs, logs, screenshots, or chat. Load secrets only from environment variables, DPAPI-encrypted local XML, SSH agent/key files, or cloud secret services. Do not print command lines that contain Spark OBS access-key/secret-key settings.

Use this skill together with the general `huawei-cloud-bigdata` skill when available.

## Repository Shape

The working repo used for the original POC was:

`C:\Users\Matebook\Documents\Codex\2026-05-13\ai-bi-1-1-obs-mrs`

Important repo areas:

- `infra/terraform/`: Huawei Cloud OBS, VPC, subnet, ECS, EIP, DWS, MRS, security-group rules.
- `scripts/`: credential bootstrap, Terraform secure plan/apply helpers, Superset credential lookup.
- `deploy/`: Nginx, systemd API service, Superset install helper.
- `server/monitor_api.py`: small lifecycle status API on `127.0.0.1:8090`.
- `pipelines/sec_edgar_to_obs.py`: stream SEC EDGAR public filings to OBS raw.
- `pipelines/spark_clean_financial_data.py`: MRS Spark raw-to-silver/gold job.
- `sql/dws_schema.sql`: DWS serving schema.
- `index.html`, `app.js`, `styles.css`: public monitoring website.

Read `references/RUNBOOK.md` for the full end-to-end deployment, commands, and troubleshooting record.

## End-To-End Workflow

1. Bootstrap credentials locally.
   - Run `scripts/huawei-cloud-credentials.ps1` for Huawei Cloud and Superset inputs.
   - Run `scripts/bigdata-service-passwords.ps1` for DWS/MRS service passwords.
   - Store secrets under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Codex\huawei-cloud-bigdata\*.xml` with DPAPI.
   - Keep `terraform.tfvars` free of plaintext passwords.

2. Provision cloud infrastructure.
   - Use Terraform under `infra/terraform`.
   - Plan through `scripts/terraform-plan-secure.ps1`; apply through `scripts/terraform-apply-existing-plan.ps1`.
   - Region default for this POC is `la-south-2`.
   - Use pay-per-use resources for POC.
   - Confirm Huawei Cloud quotas, current flavor names, and price before applying.

3. Deploy the monitoring website and API.
   - ECS hosts Nginx, static website, Superset, and `bigdata-monitor-api`.
   - Nginx serves `/` and proxies `/api` to `127.0.0.1:8090`.
   - API reads `/var/lib/bigdata-monitor/events.jsonl`.

4. Stream public data into OBS.
   - Use `pipelines/sec_edgar_to_obs.py`.
   - Required env: `SEC_USER_AGENT`, `HUAWEICLOUD_ACCESS_KEY`, `HUAWEICLOUD_SECRET_KEY`, `OBS_ENDPOINT`, `OBS_BUCKET`.
   - Target layout: `raw/sec-edgar/...`; write a manifest under `raw/sec-edgar/manifests/`.
   - Emit `download` and `obs` monitor events to `/api/events`.

5. Run MRS Spark processing.
   - Copy or stage `pipelines/spark_clean_financial_data.py`.
   - Read `obs://BUCKET/raw/sec-edgar/`.
   - Write silver Parquet to `obs://BUCKET/silver/sec-edgar/`.
   - Write gold Parquet and CSV to `obs://BUCKET/gold/sec-edgar/topic_daily*`.
   - Emit `mrs` monitor events.

6. Load DWS.
   - Initialize `finance_monitor` schema with `sql/dws_schema.sql`.
   - Load gold CSV into `finance_monitor.fact_financial_topic_daily`.
   - Use temporary `.pgpass` on ECS only when needed; delete it immediately.
   - Emit `dws` monitor events.

7. Configure Superset.
   - Run Superset on ECS, exposed on port `8088`.
   - Install PostgreSQL driver inside the Superset runtime if missing.
   - Create database connection to DWS, dataset `finance_monitor.fact_financial_topic_daily`, charts, and dashboard.
   - Use ASCII metric aliases in chart params; titles may be localized, but SQL aliases should stay ASCII.
   - Emit `bi` monitor events.

8. Validate every layer.
   - Monitoring website: `GET /`.
   - API: `GET /api/health`, `GET /api/status`.
   - OBS object counts and byte sizes.
   - MRS wrapper log and YARN application state.
   - DWS row counts.
   - Superset chart data API.

## Resource Baseline

This POC used a minimum practical baseline:

- ECS web/Superset: small 2 vCPU / 4 GB class with EIP.
- OBS: Standard bucket for raw/silver/gold.
- MRS: Spark/Hive-capable cluster, 2 masters + 3 cores, bigdata Linux flavors, 600 GB root/data disks in the tested region.
- DWS: 3-node smallest available DWS shape in the selected region.
- Superset: Docker on ECS, private DWS connectivity.

Treat these as POC-only starting points. Reconfirm current Huawei Cloud regional availability before deploying.

## Verification Checklist

Use these checks before saying the pipeline is complete:

- Raw OBS data is at or above the target byte size.
- MRS log contains `END status=0`.
- YARN application final state is `SUCCEEDED`.
- Gold CSV exists under `gold/sec-edgar/topic_daily_csv/part-*.csv`.
- DWS fact table returns nonzero rows.
- `/api/status` shows all five stages as `success`.
- Superset dashboard opens and both charts query successfully.
- Public website has no stale localized text after any requested language change.

## Troubleshooting Memory

Key failures from the original run:

- Terraform missing: install or use `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Terraform\terraform.exe`; helper scripts resolve this path.
- Public IP changed: update `admin_cidr` and reapply security-group rules.
- MRS flavor/component mismatch: use actual regional MRS `3.5.0-LTS` components and `.linux.bigdata` flavors.
- MRS OBS connector agency failure: use job-level Basic OBS credentials if no MRS agency is configured, but never print command lines containing the secret key.
- MRS SFTP unavailable: copy files to MRS via SSH pipe instead of `scp`/SFTP.
- CRLF in remote shell scripts: convert to LF and avoid fragile backslash continuations.
- Stale PID files: check both PID liveness and `END status=` in log.
- Superset `No module named psycopg2`: install `psycopg2-binary` into the Superset runtime site-packages and restart.
- Superset `'ascii' codec can't encode characters`: chart metric labels are used as SQL aliases; change metric labels to ASCII.
- Browser still shows old text: add a cache-busting query string to `app.js`.
- PowerShell encoding can corrupt Chinese JSON: send JSON as UTF-8 bytes when posting events.

## User-Facing Defaults

When explaining the resulting dashboard:

- `form_type` is SEC filing type: `10-K`, `10-Q`, `8-K`, `20-F`, `6-K`.
- `risk_topic` is a simple keyword-derived tag: `credit`, `liquidity`, `rate`, `loan`, `general`.
- `line_count_sum` is the number of cleaned text lines matching a group.
- `file_count_sum` is the number of filings represented by a group.
- This is a POC classification, not an investment signal.

## When Continuing The Original Environment

Use local encrypted secret locations:

- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Codex\huawei-cloud-bigdata\credentials.xml`
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Codex\huawei-cloud-bigdata\bigdata-service-passwords.xml`
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Codex\huawei-cloud-bigdata\superset.xml`
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Codex\huawei-cloud-bigdata\ssh\bigdata-monitor-ed25519`
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Codex\huawei-cloud-bigdata\ssh\known_hosts`

Never expose values read from these files. For password display requests, prefer copying to the local clipboard instead of writing the password in chat.
